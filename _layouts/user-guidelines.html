<h3>Keep it civil aka don&rsquo;t be a jerk</h3>
We&rsquo;re going to get into the thick of a lot of heated discussions and that&rsquo;s okay. These discussions often entail topics that we all personally care a lot about and will passionately defend. But in order for discussions to thrive here, we need to remember to <strong>criticize ideas, not people</strong>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So, remember to avoid:
<ul>
	<li>name-calling</li>
	<li>ad hominem attacks</li>
	<li>Responding to a post&rsquo;s tone instead of its actual content.</li>
	<li>knee-jerk contradiction</li>
</ul>
<span style="line-height: 18.9091px;">Comments that we find to be hateful, inflammatory, or harassing may be removed.&nbsp;</span>If you don&rsquo;t have something nice to say about another user, don&#39;t say it. Treat others the way you&rsquo;d like to be treated.

<h3>Always strive to add value to every interaction and discussion you participate in</h3>
There are a lot of discussions that happen every day on Disqus. Before joining in a discussion, browse through some of the most recent and active discussions happening in the community, especially if you&rsquo;re new there.<br />
<br />
If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later.
<h3>Keep it tidy</h3>
Help make moderators&rsquo; lives easier by taking a moment to ensure that what you&rsquo;re about to post is in the right place. That means:

<ul>
	<li>don&rsquo;t post off-topic comments or discussions: check the&nbsp;<a href="https://disqus.com/home/explore/">Explore page</a>&nbsp;to find the appropriate channel for your topic</li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.6;">don&rsquo;t cross-</span><span style="line-height: 1.6;">post the same thing multiple times</span></li>
	<li>review any specific posting guidelines for the community: some communities&nbsp;such as a movies community may have specific rules regarding spoilers.</li>
	<li>check if another active discussion on your topic has already been posted</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you see something, say something</h3>
Moderators are at the forefront of combatting spam, mediating disputes and enforcing community guidelines and, so are you.&nbsp;<br />
